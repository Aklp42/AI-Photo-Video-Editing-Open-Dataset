# maadaa.ai AI Photo-Video Editing Open Dataset Collection


We are proud to present our expansive "AI Photo-Video Editing Standard Dataset Collection", a carefully curated compendium designed to foster innovation within the growing photo and video editing industry.

AI photo-video editing apps are becoming the hot Apps which can help you create, edit, and enhance photos/videos with ease. High-quality fine-segmented datasets are the key for such advanced Apps, enabling variable functions like matting, background virtualization, inpainting and so on.

Our collection is thoughtfully organized into 15 typical scenarios that demonstrate the complexity and variety of real-world editing requirements. It captures a broad range of environments, conditions, and objects, providing machine learning models a diverse and authentic playground for testing and refining their capabilities.

Further, our collection includes 23 meticulously annotated sub-datasets, each labelled with precision. These sub-datasets offer a vast spectrum of potential applications, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in photo and video editing.

From personalized filters to virtual background creations, realistic object insertions to sophisticated enhancements, the applications of this dataset are wide-ranging and exciting. We believe that this versatile dataset collection will not only contribute to the existing capabilities of photo and video editing apps but also inspire groundbreaking solutions and features in the field.
